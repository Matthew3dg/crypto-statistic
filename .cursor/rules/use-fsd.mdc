  Follow the Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) architecture when writing or modifying code 
  in the "next-app" project.

  Layers are standardized across all FSD projects. You don't have to use all of the layers, 
  but their names are important. There are currently seven of them (from top to bottom):

  - **App** — everything that makes the app run (routing, entrypoints, global styles, providers).
  - **Processes** — long-living business processes (e.g., auth-flow).
  - **Pages** — pages composed of widgets/features.
  - **Widgets** — large self-contained chunks of functionality or UI, usually delivering an entire use case.
  - **Features** — reused implementations of entire product features, i.e. actions that bring business value to the user.
  - **Entities** — business entities that the project works with, like user or product.
  - **Shared** — reusable functionality, especially when it's detached from the specifics of the project/business.

  Respect the dependency rule:
  `app → processes → pages → widgets → features → entities → shared`

  Do not bypass layers using shortcuts or absolute imports.  
  Reusable logic belongs in `shared`.  
  Each feature or entity must be self-contained (UI + model + API inside its slice).
